# DOTS-Testing
Used to learn Unity's new DOTS system. Created to allow me to sync my test project between computers. Will not bother looking at pull requests and the like. If you want to edit the code yourself, you're free to create your own branch.

If you want to use the project for yourself, you're going to have to rebuild the SubScene's entity cache (in the sample scene). Otherwise you'll get errors.
