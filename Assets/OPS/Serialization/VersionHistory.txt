1.5.1
- Change: Maximal String length is now set too: 65535 (uint max value)! Old length was: 1073741824. 
  The problem: Too much memory got allocated for the strings. You can change the length in: OPS.Serialization.Byte ByteReader and ByteWriter.
- Improvement: Improved some exception messages.

1.5
- Add: Dictionary Serialization

1.4
- To allow better serialization customization and because of multiple questions, you have
  now directly access to the source code.

1.3
- Added Async serialization/deserialization

1.2.1
- Struct support

1.2
- Multidimensional arrays are now serializable!
[Important! Because of the added multidimensionality, serialized arrays from prior versions than 1.2 are not compatible with 1.2 or later!]
- Added serialization of 2D and 3D Colliders.
[Note! Shared components of colliders like rigidybody or sharedmesh wont be serialized!]
